# Citation Saver

## What This Thing Does

Citation Saver allows you to link directly back to content you highlight on a page--that way you can cite text on a page and return to it later.

If you follow a Citation Saver link in another browser (or if you decide to uninstall Citation Saver), your link will still be valid and will take you to the same page; your browser just won't automatically highlight the citation.

This is not a link shortening service. I'm not logging any of your page visits; the experience takes place entirely in your browser.
