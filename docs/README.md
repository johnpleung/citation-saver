## What This Thing Does

Citation Saver allows you to link directly back to content you highlight on a page--that way you can cite text on a page and return to it later.

This is not a link shortening service. We're not logging any of your page visits; the experience takes place entirely in your browser.


## How To Use This Thing

1. Highlight some content on a page.

2. Right-click it.

3. Click "Get citation link."

4. Click the provided Citation Saver link to copy it to your clipboard. Done! When you navigate to this link in the future


## How to Support This Thing

There's an innocuous ad that appears when you create a Citation Saver link. Click it if you're so inclined!
