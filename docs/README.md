# Citation Saver

## What This Thing Does

Citation Saver allows you to link directly back to content you highlight on a page--that way you can cite text on a page and return to it later.

If you follow a Citation Saver link in another browser (or if you decide to uninstall Citation Saver), your link will still be valid and will take you to the same page; your browser just won't automatically highlight the citation.

This is not a link shortening service. We're not logging any of your page visits; the experience takes place entirely in your browser.

## How To Use This Thing

1. Highlight some content on a page.

2. Right-click it.

3. Click "Get citation link."

4. Click the provided Citation Saver link to copy it to your clipboard. Done!

There's an innocuous ad that appears when you create a Citation Saver link. Click it if you're so inclined!
